Create a render in blender.

## Submission
- Upload a 1920x1080 or 16:9 4k **.jpg** or **.png** file.
- Upload a screenshot of the blender scene and outliner for academic integrity purposes.

## Technical Requirements
- 16:9 aspect "widescreen" ratio. (i.e.: 1920x1080) or 9:16 (1080p but vertical).
- Animation is discouraged.
- Must be a full render "scene" - no solid color or transparent image backdrop.
- Significant models are original creations. You can use external assets/textures/hdris/models, etc. This is vague, because "it depends". If you are even slightly worried that your work is not original enough, simply ask for approval.
- Texturing is encouraged, but a non-textured aesthetic is permitted.

## Creative Requirements
- You have freedom to make what you want. Realistic or stylized. Environment or indoor. Realistic or fantasy. The only rule: It can not be abstract. No desktop backgrounds. It must contain *things* that are *identifiable*.
- This render must be an original composition.
- Render must be a scene, not a "product shot" of a single model.
- Create at least 2-3 original 3D models to use in your scene.
  - A room/backdrop/terrain counts as a model. An HDRi or skybox does not.
  - **Include at least 3 models, but less if your model reaches a certain degree of complexity that I approve it as counting 'double'.**
- If the finished render does not contain all models (for creative reasons) then include screenshots of the other models you made for the assignment.
- Scene must be a lit render. You can use HDRis instead of lights, but no "unlit", "flat", or "AO-pass" renders.

## Purpose
- Practice creating 3D models that are "as good as they need to be" - used for a specific desired output. *Modeling the backs or bottoms of things? Maybe not important if they aren't visible in the render.*
- Explore creative lighting and composition
- Our projects so far have been expanding in potential outputs and next-steps. This is the first project where the output/deliverable is just a *thing* that is made from our complex process, and we need to tailor our workflow accordingly.
