title: "Extra Credit Option: Design A Game"
order: 101
---

**Design a game**. Video games, card games, board games, field games,
road trip games -- anything. There are few constraints on the format of
a reasonable game.

**Submit instructions & credits** an external document that explains the
games rules and how to play. Also credits for all tools and assets that
you used.

**Submit the game.** If the game is playable on its own. If it is not,
like a field game, submit a video of playing the game. If it is a card
or board game, submit your paper prototype if possible.

## Constraints

-   The game cannot violate the Chatham code of conduct, all players
    must be playing consensually and be aware of the game's existence
-   The game cannot, to your knowledge, already exist
-   You must have the right to use all assets that you include, (and, of course, credit them).
-   You cannot work in groups. This is an individual assignment
-   The game cannot be a simple remix or single-mechanic change of an
    existing game
-   Designing a level for an existing game does not count
-   Get my permission before using a games built-in level editor
    -   Some will not count (Portal 2 Puzzle Creator) but others might
        (Neverwinter Nights 2)
-   You cannot use Roblox
-   You cannot use a follow-along YouTube tutorial
    -   This assignment is about *design*, not *execution*
-   Get my permission before making a narrative game
    -   *They\'re great, but too much time spent writing, not enough
        designing/iterating. It makes for an unhelpful assignment*

## Where to start:
<https://tinytools.directory/>

*Bitsy, Twine, Puzzlescript, Scratch, etc.*

*I would give serious thought to designing a card or board game.*
