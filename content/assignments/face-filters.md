title: Face Filters
---

Create two face filters using Lens Studio and write a document for them.

The filters do not need to be published, they will be judged entirely in via their documentation.

One filter should facilitate "gesture", and the other should facilitate "expressing an identity/sense of self".

### Submission
The filters will be graded without being installed or used. This means teh full documentation of the face filters in use is, really, the focus.

For each filter:
- Video capture of the filter
- One page documentation file in print-ready format (ie: .pdf or .html)
- readme.txt with attributions, etc (see syllabus).

Upload .pdf with embedded images to brightspace. Include a video files separately.   

### Documentation
Include the following:
-	Face Filter Name
-	Filter description
-	Screenshot of filter
-	Short gif or embedded video of filter being used (not neccesary embedded in the document).
-	Captured video (for formats where embedding is possible)
-	Goals of the filter (is it identity or gesture, and what is your goal)
-	Artist’s statement (how the filter achieves it’s goals, why you decided to make it, why it is important to you/the world, why it would/should be used)

In the readme.txt file:
- Name, class, section, year/semester, assignment
- Filter description
-	Credits for any used assets

#### Notes on Identity
An "Identity" face filter should allow someone to express an an ephemeral social identity – a mood, emotion, sentiment, etc; that assists an individual in connecting with others. One is claiming membership of an in-group, like sports fandoms. This is identity with a lowercase i. How might I communicate my identity of “cat dad” with a face filter, instead of my normal approach of dragging my cat from has nap and holding him up to the camera.

We express our identities constantly: The clothing and styles we choose, how we decorate our environments, the kinds of brands we purchase, the way we choose to affect our language or sign our emails, the sports teams we represent – we are constantly, metaphorically, shouting “this is who I am” to the world.

> You cannot choose identities that may violate inclusive policies or are otherwise problematic. For example, many “identities” are labels as social bias laundering; things like white nationalists, incels, terfs, or MGTOW. Similarly, avoid ethnic and racial identities. One must consider how individuals who are not part of the identity we are trying to represent would utilize our face filters: we are not creating tools that enable one to wear the skin of someone else.

#### Notes on Gesture
A "Gesture" face filter must provide a secondary communicative expression that allows for richer communication. It is not necessarily merely amplifying an expression. It could involve layers of subtext or an ironic reversal. These are depths of communication we constantly use in face-to-face conversation but are more limited in informal writing (ie: texting). Emoji, emoticons, animated gifs, punctuation, and **TeXt** *StyLinG* can all act as a gesture or indicator of tone. Face filters open new doors to gesture, allowing one to use the personal expressiveness of facial expressions, elements of film composition (like timing, montage/cuts, juxtaposition, and framing) and juxtapositions with content like sound effects, on screen image elements, and more.

See the McCulloch reading for mroe on Gesture.

#### Notes on Artist Statement
Consider the following questions:
- "Why is someone using this filter?"
- "What is this filter helping someone communicate?"
- "Why is this interesting to me?"
- "Who cares?"
- "What do I need to know in order to understand this filter?"
- "What should I be thinking about as I use the filter?"

#### Examples
*See Hunter for visuals.*

Some Previous Student Projects:
- Fox from Melee Mask ("I am being competitive")
- "WAT" (A gesture that emphasized sudden confusion)
- Mandelorian Helmet (an identity of fandom)
- Butterflyface (A satirical identity of makeup user)
- Elephant in The Room (ie: feeling like a wallflower)
- Dead Tired (gesture borrowing imagery from cartoons)
- Deal With it Sunglasses (Gesture allowing one to imitate popular gif)
- Anime Glasses Sheen/Sparkle (Gesture for "This is Serious")
- Today is Football (soccarball head, ironic imagery to express for "I don't understand sports")
- Chewbacca (identity of fandom. Notably fun as a visual way to encourage one to (attempt to) make the noise)
- It's [time] and I'm RUNNING LATE (Gesture)
- Courage the Cowardly Dog Mask (Gesture to react to or consider something as scary)
