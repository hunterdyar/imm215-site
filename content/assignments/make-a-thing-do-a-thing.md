Create a new project or use the character controller. Or use someone else's character controller.

Your assignment is to implement a behaviour into a 2D game (prototype).

You will come up with an idea, and then email the professor for apporoval - your idea must be approved as being complex enough to 'count'.

### Minimum Requirements
- 2 Scripts with some dependency (ie: a public function on one being called by the other)
- Clean code, appropriate names/comments, etc
- The behaviour is described and effective
- I can make a reasonable guess as to what the code does from reading it
- Approved Complexity.

### Possible Behaviours
- Shooting things
- Collecting things
- Weird advanced movement, like teleportation? Dash?
- Game Manager
- Something with a timer

## Submission
Upload all script files. Project will be reviewed during class.
