title: Playground Revision
order: 3
---
This assignment will is the same as Unity Playground, with a catch.

You are going to improve, revise, or redesign a space originally chosen by a *different student*.

Your new project will be assigned randomly.

You will be starting again from scratch, although you can connect with the student you have been assigned for any of the assets that they used. You also need to credit them in your project, of course.

1. Create an instantly recognizable environment in Unity from a prompt chosen by a different student.
2. Become an expert in another thing.
3. **Further**, The space should be viewable from a single point of view looking around in all directions. Position the camera appropriately, and assume we can rotate the camera freely, but not move it's position.

### Purpose
- Applying knowledge of perception lecture to a project.
- Critically thinking about how spaces are perceived while designing them.
- Designing a space for a chosen perspective.
- Practice in Unity.
- Practice sharing and moving assets around.
- Practice creating environments in 3D.
- Engagement in an analytical and iterative creative workflow.

### Submission
Like before, submit a screenshot of the project, but you also must include the readme.txt file that answers the following questions:

1. What and whose space did you start with?
2. What did you do differently?
3. How did you utilize an understanding of perception to better "sell" your space as a 3D environment?

This readme should also include your name, the class title/section, and credits to any assets used. See the syllabus for more information on readme requirements.
