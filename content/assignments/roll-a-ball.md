Follow along with part 1 and 2, at least, of [The Intro Lectures](https://guidebook.hdyar.com/docs/unity/unity-fundamentals/the-intro-lectures/).

Your Roll-A-Ball project can be looked at in class, there is nothing to submit.

If you know you will be absent during the class period that these are checked, then you may upload a video recording of your screen and Unity editor, going into play mode and looking at the script you wrote.
