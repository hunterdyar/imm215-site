title: Unity Playground
order: 2
---
1.  Construct a Scene in Unity. Using primitives, and materials, build a
    room or scene of some kind that **is immediately and instantly clear
    to the user where they are.**

    -   Goals: Get practice/time navigating a viewport, moving and
        manipulating objects
    -   Stretch goals: importing assets from the asset store
    -   0% Bonus: Have an hierarchy with understandably named
        GameObjects

2.  Go out and research one *thing*. Become an expert about one tiny
    little part of Unity game development. Read it's documentation page.
    Make an example thing. Become someone who could show others how to
    do it. If applicable, implement this *thing* into your scene.
    Otherwise, try to demonstrate what you learned in another scene or a
    written document. Some *things* you could research are listed below.

    -   Goals: Execute a self directed research workflow in Unity.
    -   Stretch Goals: What you taught yourself is useful
    -   For those with coding experience: 'scripting' is not applicable
        as a *thing*, but some specific scripting tool or utility could
        be.
### Submission
Take a screenshot of your Hierarchy window, and of your game window. Upload it for the assignment before class. During class, We will go around and share our creations.

Don't forget the readme.txt file (see syllabus for details).

### Becoming an Expert on one "thing"

How do you become an expert on one little part of unity? Research! Look
that thing up. Read the unity manual page on it. Read any other official
documentation about it. Find a youtube video maybe. But what to pick?
There's a list below of some options, but feel free to surprise me. If
you have used Unity before, the thing you pick should be new to you.
This is about you going through the process of researching something you
don't know about. I care less about this specific something being useful
to use long term, although it is nice to have at least one little thing
you know you have under control. Some things are easier than others,
which isn't "fair". That's ...fine. I expect you to challenge yourself
to your ability. This assignment shouldn't need to take longer than an
hour or two regardless any prior experience you may or may not have.

### A few possible Things to research:

-   Skyboxes (what\'s a cubemap? What\'s equirectangular?)
-   The Post Processing Stack Package (This one is fun. How much BLOOM
    is too much?)
-   Colliders vs. Triggers (maybe: whats OnTriggerEnter)
-   Playing a sound (make a crazy piano)
-   Physics materials. Make a bounce platform!
-   An object that rotates as an obstacle, like a windmill on a minigolf
    course
-   Add various lights of various types and edit and adjust them to make
    a good-looking level and not necessarily like a disco-wonderland.
-   Emission Materials
-   Order of Execution of Event Functions
-   Static Objects
-   Tag's
-   Layers. What are they good for?
-   Layer Masks (and physics collision layers)
-   Navigation, NavMeshes, And NavMeshAgents
-   Unity's Terrain tools
-   The absurd "Tree" object (Can you make a good looking tree?)
-   Trail Renderer component. It\'s wonderful. (and easy and fun)
-   Particle Effects. (Be warned, it\'s easy to get something but hard
    to get something good. Lots of tweaking and fiddling. Worth every
    second)
-   Importing and using textures in materials (make a texture in
    photoshop (filter\>render\>clouds, filter\>noise\>add noise,
    gradient map, etc); don\'t use asset store for this.
-   Unity UI and the ever-obtuse RectTransform.
-   Cinemachine (can you automate a camera to fly through the scene and
    blend between states? No scripting needed, it can all be done with
    the cinemachine package)
-   ProBuilder/ProGrids packages (there's a good 30min talk on unity's
    youtube page)
-   2D Sprite Editor -- Can you rig a 2D image with *bones?*
-   The new Timeline features in unity 2019
-   Tilemaps
-   SpriteShapes
-   TextMeshPro
-   Unity's built in Cloth Simulation component
-   And so much more! There's all sorts of stuff in Unity, you can
    choose just about anything. Try looking through [The Unity Blog](https://blog.unity.com/), archives where they often write posts about new or experimental features.
